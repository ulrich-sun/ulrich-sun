### Hi there, I'm < Ulrich SUN /> ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ’» My name is Ulrich Steve NOUMSI, Engineer in computer systems and networks (Bac+3), graduate of the African Institute of Informatics (IAI) representation of Cameroon, Design Engineer in Administration and security of computer networks (Bac+5) ENSPD I live in Cameroon and I am currently training in Cloud engineering.

I have 03 years of experience in DevOps and Cloud more precisely on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

Having good technical knowledge and skills in development and operations, I learned the DevOps methodology in a self-taught way that I have practiced in several teams and companies in the process of application development and deployment in the cloud. I have a DevOps Engineer profile. 

I have also worked as an intern in System and Network Administration in several companies with the mission of designing and administering infrastructures on site and in the cloud in order to support companies in the migration or implementation of their infrastructure in the cloud. I also have a profile of Cloud engineer.

And I joined Connect Technology as a DevOps Engineer and Systems Administrator where I actively participated in the integration of the DevOps culture within the enterprise infrastructure management teams and also in the identification of risks, needs and security requirements up to the implementation of a global security policy on the development, testing and production process of client applications within our infrastructure. I also have a profile as an IT security specialist.

My future goal is to be able to put together my knowledge and technical skills in DevOps, Cloud and Cybersecurity in order to have as a result a profile of a DevSecOps and Cloud AWS / Azure Engineer.
